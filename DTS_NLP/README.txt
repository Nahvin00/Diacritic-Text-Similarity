Notes:

1. Diacritic Text Similarity application is developed based on
   Python and it can run only if Python is installed in the system.
2. To check if Python has been installed in your system, press 
   (windows key + R). Run prompt will be showing, type 'cmd' and 
   click ok.
3. Your command prompt will open, type 'python' and press enter. 
   If your system has Python installed, it will show the python 
   version in the console. If it says unrecognized, please 
   download and install Python from this link 
   (https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/).
4. Navigate to the DTS_NLP file directory, right-click and click 
   on Open in Windows Terminal.
5. Inside the Windows terminal, type 
   'pip install -r requirements.txt' to download and install 
   necessary packages to run the application. Bare in mind that 
   downloading all the packages can take a while.

   application. This shortcut can be placed anywhere in your system 
   and works fine as long as no modification to root directory.
